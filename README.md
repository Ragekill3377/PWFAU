# PWFAU
Recently migrated to arch Linux and find the ‘pacman’ package manager weird? Or perhaps the package installer? Chances are you’re a Debian user. Fear less, for my useless wrapper which I made because I was bored will help! 

# Steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ragekill3377/PWFAU.git && cd PWFAU && sudo chmod +x * && sudo mv apt /usr/bin/local | sudo mv dpkg /usr/bin/local
```
# License:
Seriously? For THIS?! Imagine having a license for this :p.
In 'seriousness' do whatever you want. (Yeah I'm not funny **am I**?)
